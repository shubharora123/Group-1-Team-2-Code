# In the "Final Code" Branch there is all the code you need to run the webserver, connect to the ev3, and remotely control it. When you download all the files put them all in one folder and open that folder in VSCODE. Make sure your ev3 is connected to the internet, has ev3dev on a micro sd card in the ev3 brick, and that your VSCODE has the ev3dev Extention downloaded. Then using VSCode connect to your ev3 and push that folder of code to it. From the ev3 select the file EV3D4WebControl.py and run it. Then on your browser go to the ip address displayed on your ev3 on the port 8000. Now you are done and can control your robot!!
